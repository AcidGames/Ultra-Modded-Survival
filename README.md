# Ultra-Modded-Survival
An issue tracker for the Ultra Modded-Survival modpack created by Amaxter and distributed via the Technic Platform.

If you have a crash report or logs (found in Modpack options in launcher > Open Pack Directory and then crash reports folder or logs folder) then please submit them via a service like pastebin.com so that they don't take up so much space. Any crashes/logs submitted in plain text will be ignored.

If there is a bug/issue you are noticing please be as specific as possible in describing it, the more specific, the more helpful you will be! Mod suggestions will be ignored and likely closed as this pack is based off the YouTube series and is following that with no exceptions aside from client tweaks. 

> Crash reports without Pastebin suck, and they should burn in a fire

-A very smart man
